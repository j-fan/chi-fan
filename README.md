吃饭 (Chi-Fan) is a visual arts / heritage studies project tracing the intimate stories and migration of family recipes across the contested “Chinese diaspora”.

Materialising as a minigame, audiences enter animated kitchens which are vivified by
interviews between young people who identify as a member of the Chinese diaspora and their
relatives about a family recipe. Each kitchen features: audio ruminations about the recipe;
photo essays of the cooking methodology; the dish’s cultural significance; and intimate
vignettes of domestic spaces.

By playfully weaving these interpretations of a ‘family recipe’, 吃饭 (Chi-Fan) presents an
alternative version of the ‘Chinese diaspora’ - beyond surnames, passports or dialects. The
project gives licence for the interrogation of who defines cultural history.

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.
